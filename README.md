# emiliaswinoptmization

most of the stuff I found only n tweak a little bit.

for the EXM join their discord server to know more about, but i just use the internet, mouse n keyboard, n disable winupdates.
(just put EXM Tweaks Discord on your browser)

for win11 I like to use start all back, becouse the fucking taskbar is atrocious and giant.

and if you having someproblems disable the low latency mode on the nvidia control panel for somereason this thing make games laggier once in a while especially cs2. 

for even better results you can use Atlas OS, Revi OS, or something that might have a virus like kernel os, spectre, xso or someshit like, that dont change nothing just cause more compatibility stress, download aimlab your problem is not latency is your brain.
